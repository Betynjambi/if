1. Conditional Statements
if, elif, else
Conditional statements allow you to execute certain blocks of code based on specific conditions.
2. Looping Constructs
for Loop
The for loop iterates over a sequence (e.g., list, tuple, string) and executes a block of code for each item in the sequence.
while Loop
The while loop repeats a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
Loop Control Statements
Python provides loop control statements to alter the flow of loop execution:
break: Terminates the loop prematurely.
continue: Skips the rest of the current iteration and proceeds to the next iteration.
3. Exception Handling
Python allows you to handle exceptions gracefully using try, except, else, and finally blocks.
